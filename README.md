# RISC-V Simulator

This project was developed by me to simulate and study the behaviour of RISC-V, a technology lectured in FSC @ LEIC, feup.

I am using *Python* and looking to improve this program to be the most realistic approximation to the one used in RISC-V

Any issues should be mentioned to be looked at and, therefore, solved.
